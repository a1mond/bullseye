# Bullseye
This is a game built using SwiftUI. Reference of a design in <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/3MBMeYd2hP4rajTbHnZL0z/Bullseye?node-id=0%3A1">Figma</a>.
Currently the game is not available neither in App Store or TestFlight, with which I will be dealing in a future.

## What is it and how to play
Bullseye is a simple game where you have a slider and you need to estimate it's value as close as you can to given target. Of course, you don't know what value of slider it is, which is, basically, a point of the game. Closer your estimation is - more points earned!
